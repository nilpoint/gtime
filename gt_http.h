/**
 * \file gt_http.h
 *
 * \brief Guardtime client SDK, public header file for HTTP transport module.
 *
 * This module offers the functions to communicate with the Guardtime
 * network over the HTTP protocol.
 *
 * The three main functions are:
 * - creating a timestamp (the resulting PKI-signed timestamp
 * can be verified using the Guardtime public key certificate);
 * - extending a timestamp (the resulting hash-linked timestamp
 * can be verified independently from Guardtime for unlimited time);
 * - verifying a timestamp; the following diagram illustrates the
 * decision process:
 * \image html ApiVerifyTimestamp.png
 * \image latex ApiVerifyTimestamp.pdf "" width=15cm
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 *
 * <b>Linux</b>
 *
 * The networking functions in this module rely on cURL. The use of
 * the cURL code is covered by the license available online from
 * <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs/copyright.html">curl.haxx.se/docs/copyright.html</a>
 * and also enclosed in the file \c licence.curl.txt.
 *
 * Multi-platform source code for cURL can be dowloaded from
 * <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl.haxx.se</a>.
 * This version of the Guardtime SDK has been tested with cURL 7.18.1.
 *
 * Although it's not difficult to compile cURL on Linux, most distributions
 * also provide prebuilt binaries through their normal package management
 * facilities. When installing a prebuilt package, make sure you pick a
 * "developer" version, otherwise you may only get the tools and utilities,
 * but no libraries or headers.
 *
 * To compile a program that uses both the HTTP module and Guardtime base
 * API, use a command along the lines of
 * \code
 *    gcc example.c -o example -I/usr/local/gt/include \
 *    -L/usr/local/gt/lib -L/usr/local/curl/lib -L/usr/local/ssl/lib \
 *    -lgthttp -lgtbase -lcurl -lcrypto -lrt
 * \endcode
 * (either with the backslashes or all on a single line) replacing
 * \c /usr/local/gt, \c /usr/local/curl and \c /usr/local/ssl with
 * the directories where you unpacked the Guardtime, cURL and OpenSSL libraries.
 *
 * <b>Windows</b>
 *
 * The networking functions in this module rely on WinINet, which comes
 * standard on all supported versions of Windows.
 *
 * To compile a program that uses both the HTTP module and Guardtime base
 * API, use a command along the lines of
 * \code
 *    cl.exe /MT example.c /I C:\gt\include
 *    /link /libpath:C:\gt\lib /libpath:C:\openssl\lib
 *    libgthttpMT.lib libgtbaseMT.lib libeay32MT.lib
 *    wininet.lib user32.lib gdi32.lib advapi32.lib crypt32.lib
 * \endcode
 * (all on a single line) replacing
 * \c C:\\gt and \c C:\\openssl with
 * the directories where you unpacked the Guardtime and OpenSSL libraries.
 *
 * When compiling, keep in mind that mixing code compiled with different
 * \c /Mxx settings is dangerous. It's best to always use the
 * Guardtime and OpenSSL libraries that match the \c /Mxx
 * setting you specified for compiling your own source code.
